= Test 2


== Goal

Install Logstash and Elastic Search on a single Ubuntu VM and run Elastic Search as a service.

This will be done using Chef.


== Plan

* Install ChefDK
* Create a basic cook book to develop against Docker
* Add test kitchen tests
* Write the recipes
* Once it is working in Docker get VirtualBox working on my laptop
* Document


== Decisions

* Write my own cookbook rather than using the community one but mention the community one in the notes.
* Do this in Vagrant with Docker first as it will be faster and VirtualBox does not currently work on my laptop.
